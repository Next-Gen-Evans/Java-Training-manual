## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this training, learners will be able to:

- Understand the concept and lifecycle of Java Applets  
- Compile and run applets using legacy tools like `appletviewer`  
- Create interactive applets using `Button`, `TextField`, and event handling  
- Debug applets and understand sandbox security restrictions  
- Perform migration from applet-based code to modern **Java Swing** or **JavaFX** applications

## 🧠 Training Outline

1. **Introduction to Applets** – What they are, how they worked, and why they’re deprecated  
2. **Applet Lifecycle** – `init()`, `start()`, `paint()`, `stop()`, `destroy()`  
3. **Demo 1:** Compile and run `HelloApplet.java` using `appletviewer`  
4. **Demo 2:** Embed an applet in an HTML page (legacy method)  
5. **Example:** Interactive `ButtonApplet` with event handling  
6. **Hands-On Exercises:**
   - Modify `HelloApplet` to display current time  
   - Add text input for a personalized greeting  
   - Create a simple moving animation  
7. **Debugging Tips & Security**  
8. **Migration Path:** Convert applet to standalone Swing app  
9. **Quiz & Discussion**  
10. **Instructor Notes & Timing Plan**
